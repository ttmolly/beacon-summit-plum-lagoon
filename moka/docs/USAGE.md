# Install, convert, and make typed decisions

Moka runs on Linux with Python 3.10–3.13. The local release checks use an
Intel Xeon Platinum 8481C (2 cores, ~4 GiB RAM, no NVIDIA GPU). CUDA and
TensorRT paths are implemented but were not executed on that host.

```bash
python -m pip install moka
python -m pip install 'moka[demo]'      # terminal Snake
python -m pip install 'moka[convert]'   # export from original checkpoints
```

Inference installs ONNX Runtime, NumPy, Tokenizers, Safetensors and Hugging Face
Hub. It does not require PyTorch or Transformers. The optional `[convert]` extra
installs PyTorch for exporting the original checkpoints.

## Select a model

| Bundle | Default engine | Capacity | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local `moka convert` of `convaiinnovations/laya` | CPU EP | 512 tokens | English ModernBERT-large, 421M |
| Local `moka convert` of `convaiinnovations/laya-typed-decisions` | CPU EP | 1024 tokens | Typed-decisions fine-tune, 421M |
| Local `moka convert` of `convaiinnovations/laya-multilingual` | CPU EP | 1024 tokens | mmBERT-base, 322M |
| `moka-tiny` (shipped student) | CPU EP / WASM | 96 tokens | CI, studio, fidelity plumbing |

`moka-tiny` is a compact student trained on synthetic triage and Snake
scaffolds. It is **not** a Hub Laya checkpoint. It exists so the conversion
graph, ORT session, calibration and Snake policy can be run on a 2-core CI
box. Treat its answers as a demo of the *runtime*, not a claim about Laya
task accuracy.

## Python API

```python
import moka

agent = moka.load("./models/typed")
result = agent.predict(
    "The customer asks for a refund of a duplicate payment.",
    {
        "department": {
            "type": "choice",
            "instructions": "Which department should handle this request?",
            "criteria": {
                "billing": "Payments, invoices, refunds, and duplicate charges.",
                "technical": "Broken features, errors, and product troubleshooting.",
                "sales": "Pricing, upgrades, and new purchases.",
            },
        },
        "urgency": {
            "type": "score",
            "instructions": "How urgent is this?",
            "criteria": ["not urgent", "soon", "blocking"],
        },
        "refund": {
            "type": "noul",
            "instructions": "Does the customer request a refund?",
        },
    },
)
print(result["answers"])
```

`choice` returns a selected label and a probability for every label. `score`
returns the expected zero-based category index, its legend and probabilities.
`noul` returns the probability of true. Answers also include upstream confidence
and action-head probability fields. `usage.output_tokens` is always 0.

```python
agent = moka.load("./models/typed", provider="cuda")       # NVIDIA
agent = moka.load("./models/typed", provider="openvino")   # Intel, opt-in
agent = moka.load("./models/typed", provider="tensorrt")   # opt-in, gated
agent = moka.load("./models/typed", deterministic=True)    # threads=1, no mem arena
```

`provider="auto"` is **CPU only**. GPU is never implicit.

Following upstream v0.3.5, fitted calibration temperatures are clamped to
`[0.5, 5.0]` before use. Raw values remain on `agent.temperature_raw` and
`agent.temperature_by_options_raw`. A `RuntimeWarning` names every clamped
bucket at load.

## CLI

```bash
moka convert <source> <output-dir> [--precision fp32|fp16] [--quantize int8]
moka predict <bundle> --state "..." --questions questions.json
moka validate <bundle> --reference <original-checkpoint> [--laya <snapshot>]
moka benchmark <bundle> --runs 100 --questions 1
moka-snake --model <bundle> --headless --steps 200 --record snake.json
```

`--offline` / `local_files_only=True` refuses Hub access.
`--laya` also compares selected answers to `pip install laya` (that package
imports torch; `import moka` does not).

## Convert from source

Official 421M/322M conversion needs about 6.7 GiB MemAvailable for the large
checkpoints and 20 GiB free disk for all three. This host does not have that.
The commands below are the ones to run where it does. Full pins, snapshot
paths, and the batch-1 plus batch-8 benchmark rows are in
[RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md). `models/typed`, `models/english`, and `models/multi`
are refused if the source is not the matching Hub safetensors.

```bash
pip install 'moka[convert]'
moka convert laya-typed-decisions models/typed
moka convert laya models/english
moka convert laya-multilingual models/multi
# approximate, and not a default unless validate prints "passed": true
moka convert laya models/english-int8 --quantize int8
```

See [CONVERSION.md](CONVERSION.md) for the graph, shape contract, and the
experiments that did not ship.
